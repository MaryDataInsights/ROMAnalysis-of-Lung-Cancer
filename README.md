Introduction 

Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadliest forms of cancer globally, often diagnosed at later stages when treatment options are limited. With lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors playing significant roles in its development, early detection and analysis of contributing variables are critical to improving patient outcomes.

This project aims to explore and analyze a structured dataset related to lung cancer patients using data analytics and visualization techniques. The dataset contains patient-level information, including demographic attributes (such as age and gender), lifestyle factors (like smoking and alcohol consumption), symptoms (e.g., coughing, fatigue), and health conditions (e.g., chronic disease, anxiety, allergy). The objective of the analysis is to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and generate actionable insights that can support public health interventions and clinical decision-making.

Observations

1. High Prevalence of Lung Cancer

Out of 309 patients, 270 were diagnosed with lung cancer, indicating a very high proportion (≈87%) of lung cancer-positive cases in the dataset.

2. Smoking as a Major Risk Factor

A large number of lung cancer patients were active smokers, reinforcing the well-established link between smoking and lung cancer development.

3. Gender Disparity

Male patients not only made up the majority of total cases but also had higher smoking rates and higher age distribution compared to females.

4. Symptoms Linked to Lung Cancer

Symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest pain, and especially fatigue were commonly reported among patients with lung cancer.

5. Chronic Disease Co-Occurrence

142 lung cancer patients also suffered from a chronic disease, suggesting a potential compounding effect of pre-existing health conditions.

6. Age Group Patterns

The majority of patients affected by lung cancer fell within the 40–59 and 60+ age groups, confirming age as a significant risk factor.

7. Low Reporting of Mental Health Factors

Fewer patients reported anxiety or peer pressure, which could indicate underreporting or lower awareness of the psychological dimensions of lung health.

Recommendations

Based on the patterns, relationships, and risk factors revealed in the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to support lung cancer prevention, early detection, and public health planning:

1. Implement Targeted Anti-Smoking Campaigns

Smoking is the most prominent behavioral risk factor observed. Stronger awareness campaigns, smoking cessation programs, and stricter tobacco regulations should be targeted, especially toward male adults.

2. Encourage Early Screening for High-Risk Age Groups

Individuals aged 40 and above should be prioritized for regular lung health screening, particularly if they have a history of smoking or display early symptoms such as coughing and wheezing.

3. Strengthen Chronic Disease Management

Since many lung cancer patients also suffer from chronic diseases, integrated care approaches should be implemented to monitor and support these individuals more closely.

4. Promote Public Education on Early Symptoms

Educating the public about early warning signs like fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain can drive early medical attention and potentially improve outcomes through early diagnosis.

5. Integrate Mental Health Awareness into Preventive Care

Although less frequently reported, anxiety and peer pressure were observed. Healthcare systems should include mental health assessments and support in routine care, especially among smokers and younger populations.

6. Develop Gender-Specific Health Interventions

Since men are more likely to smoke and develop lung cancer, gender-focused education and intervention programs can help reduce risk levels in this demographic.
